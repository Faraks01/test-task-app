# Test task app

## Overview
React-based web application built with TypeScript and Vite. It utilizes Material-UI for styling and includes various utilities for state management, routing, and date handling.
This project uses the [Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)](https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview) methodology, which is an architectural methodology for frontend projects.
FSD helps in organizing code in a way that's scalable, maintainable, and encourages separation of concerns.
